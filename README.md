# The Digital Jukebox

1. we have previously stored  songs that can be used to set a current playlist
2. Once the Jukebox is switched to ON, the system should randomly charge 5 songs to the current playlist and display it ordered by song's name.
2. Song has a name, duration, image and belongs to an artist.
3. We need to: play the current song, pause the current song, play the next song, and play the previous song.
5. We have some restrictions, if the pause button is pressed, we should not be able to press any button at all.
